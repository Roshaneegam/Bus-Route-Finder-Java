# 🚌 Bus Route Finder (Java + Dijkstra + GUI)

## 📌 Project Description

Bus Route Finder is a Java-based desktop application that finds the shortest path between bus stops using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The system models bus stops as a graph and calculates the minimum distance route through an interactive GUI built using Java Swing.

## 🚀 Features

* Finds the shortest route between two bus stops
* Displays the complete journey path
* Shows total distance in kilometers
* Includes a network of 25+ bus stops
* Allows dynamic addition of new routes
* Scrollable output area for long journeys
* Stylish dark-themed GUI

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Graph Data Structure
* Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
* Priority Queue
* Java Swing (GUI)
* Event Handling

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java
* Swing
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Data Structures & Algorithms

## 📂 Project Structure

* BusRouteGUI.java → Main GUI and user interaction
* Graph.java → Graph creation and route storage
* Dijkstra.java → Shortest path calculation logic

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Download all project files
2. Open terminal in the project folder
3. Compile the program:
   javac BusRouteGUI.java
4. Run the application:
   java BusRouteGUI

## 💡 How It Works

* Bus stops are treated as nodes in a graph
* Routes between stops are edges with distances as weights
* Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates the shortest path
* The GUI allows users to select source and destination stops easily

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

* Understanding real-world use of Dijkstra’s Algorithm
* Working with graph-based problem solving
* Building desktop GUI applications using Java Swing
* Implementing event-driven programming
